# Lab Exercise: Neural Networks and Classification

This lab is divided into three tasks. All work must be submitted in the form of Jupyter notebooks as described below.

---

## Task 1: Complete `iris_neural_network.ipynb`

- The notebook `iris_neural_networks.ipynb` is provided.
- Implement the missing sections to train a feedforward neural network on the Iris dataset.
- Requirements:
  - Normalize the data
  - Use at least one hidden layer
  - Report accuracy on the test set
  - Include relevant visualizations (e.g., confusion matrix)

**Submit:** Completed `iris_neural_networks.ipynb`

---

## Task 2: Create `digits.ipynb` Using `mnist_784.csv`

- The dataset `mnist_784.csv` is provided in the Moodle activity (not included in the lab files).
- Create a new notebook: `digits.ipynb`
- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Implement a basic feedforward neural network (using Keras or manual code)
- Report training and test accuracy
- Optional: Visualize a few digit predictions

**Submit:** New notebook `digits.ipynb`

---

## Task 3: Classification Use Case with scikit-learn MLPClassifier

- Reuse the dataset from your previous classification use case.
- Apply scikit-learnâ€™s `MLPClassifier`
- Use `GridSearchCV` to tune at least two hyperparameters (e.g., `hidden_layer_sizes`, `alpha`, `activation`)
- Report:
  - Best parameters
  - Accuracy on the test set
  - Comparison with models previously used on the same dataset

**Submit:** New notebook named `nn_usecase_<yourname>.ipynb`

---

## Submission Instructions

Upload the following to the Moodle assignment:

1. `iris_neural_networks.ipynb`
2. `digits.ipynb`
3. `nn_usecase_<yourname>.ipynb`

All notebooks must:
- Run without errors
- Be clearly commented
- Include performance metrics and relevant visualizations

---

## Deadline

Saturday July 5th.
